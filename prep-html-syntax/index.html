  <img src="https://imperialtalker.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/younglings.jpg" alt="Anakin Skywalker vs. Younglings">
  <p style="color:green;">Anakin is my favorite Star Wars character becuase his development
    from a young padawan, down a twisted path, becoming the most powerful
    Sith Lord just to try to protect his loved ones, and his
    redemption was the best arc for Star Wars of the first six movies.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">He was also my favorite because of this scene.
    He knew how to get things done with no strings attached (no spoilers for other series).</p>
